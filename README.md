This is a web page that shows users images of three products, then lets them
choose one of the three by clicking on it. After a certain number of choices
(three for testing purposes, 15 eventually), the user is show a button with
which they can display the results of their choices shown in graph form, with
the number of times each item was chosen next to the number of times it was
shown. Their choices are saved if they leave the page and return later. 

2015-01-18: put up scaffold, wrote user stories. Created layout to display
images in Flexbox. Wrote code to show images on page, and to randomize their
selection.

2015-01-19: Now counts number of clicks and times shown per item, and
calculates percentages between the two. Generates array for Charts.js to use.
Added button with click handler to call the code to generate the bar graph.

2015-01-30: Misc cleanup.
