write Product constructor
  properties:
    productName : string
    imageFile : string (points to filename)
    timesChosen : integer
    timesShown : integer
create array of Product

generate prodShown array
  for(i = 0; i < 3; )
    pick random product number
    if i > 0
      (check if previously chosen)
        if i = 1, compare to prodShown[0]
        if i = 2, compare to both prodShown[0 and 1]
      match means repeat random pick
    if not,
      write to prodShown[i] (or push)
      i += 1
    else, pick again



(pick product)
generate random number corresponding to product index
(end)

show product image(prodNumber, imageNumber)
  get prodArray[prodnumber].imageFile
  generate HTML code for element
  write to appropriate spot in DOM
   (array of elements indexed by imageNumber)





event listeners for each image box
if clicked, add 1 to choice count for chosen image,
add 1 to shown count for all 3 images,
and add 1 to count of choices made.


when choicesMade >= 15,
reveal hidden image for "Show Results"

event listener for showResults
(show only after 15 choices made)
generate table/chart showing results of survey
